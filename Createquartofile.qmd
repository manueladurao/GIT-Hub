## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

**How to create quarto file**

An quarto file is a plain text file. You can create a new text file, give it the ".qmd" extension, and start typing. But it is better to use RStudio.

If you don't see the "Quarto Document..." option, check you have quarto installed.

```{r}
install.packages("quarto")
```

## **Rendering the quarto document**

The first time you render the document, you need to save it first. Render your quarto document and examine the output. If it worked then everything is set up correctly.

For the rest of this tutorial, we will analyse plant trait data from Svalbard and make a reproducible report.

To download the data and quarto document, you need to run

```{r}
install.packages("usethis") # if you don't have it already.
usethis::use_course("biostats-r/svalbardQuartoDemo")
```
